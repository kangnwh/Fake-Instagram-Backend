# Code Structure

There are 3 main folders:
- utility : Defines some common used parameters and functions
- preprocess: Used for sampling and precalculating features
- modelling: Used for training and applying models


And every member of our team has a individual folder for their own work
- kn_work
- wuxin_work
- Comparison (zhengyu's workspace)
